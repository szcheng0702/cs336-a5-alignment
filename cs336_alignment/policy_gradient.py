    Args:
        reward_fn: Callable[[str, str], dict[str, float]],
            scores the rollout responses against the ground truths,
            producing a dict with keys
            "reward", "format_reward", and "answer_reward".
        rollout_responses: list[str], rollouts from the policy.
            The length of this list is
            `rollout_batch_size = n_prompts_per_rollout_batch * group_size`.
        repeated_ground_truths: list[str], the ground truths for the examples.
            The length of this list is `rollout_batch_size`,
            because the ground truth for each example is repeated `group_size` times.
        group_size: int, number of rollouts per question (group).
        advantage_eps: float, epsilon to avoid division by zero
            during group normalization.
        normalize_by_std: bool, whether to normalize the rewards by
            std(rewards).

    Returns:
        tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor, dict[str, float]]:
            torch.Tensor of shape (rollout_batch_size,):
                group-normalized rewards for each rollout response.
            torch.Tensor of shape (rollout_batch_size,):
                raw rewards for each rollout response.
            dict[str, float]: metadata for the rewards of the rollout batch.
                You may choose what you wish to log here
                (some statistics of the rewards, etc.).
